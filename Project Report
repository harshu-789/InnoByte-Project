Design Decisions
• Visual Appeal: The website design emphasizes a clean and visually appealing layout
to create a welcoming atmosphere for potential guests.
• User Experience: Navigation is kept simple and intuitive to ensure easy access to
information. Clear calls-to-action prompt visitors to book their stay.
• Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive across various devices,
ensuring a seamless browsing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and
smartphones.



Technical Details
The website is built using the following technologies:
• HTML: Structure and content of the web pages.
• CSS: Styling and layout of the web pages.
• JavaScript: Enhancing interactivity and functionality.
• Remix Icon: Used for icons throughout the website.
• Scroll Reveal: Provides animations for a dynamic user experience.


Maintenance and Updates
To maintain and update the website in the future, follow these instructions:
• Content Updates: Update content such as room descriptions, services, and contact
information directly in the HTML files.
• Styling Changes: Modify styles by editing the CSS files.
• Functionality Updates: Update JavaScript code in the main.js and script.js files to add
new features or improve existing ones.
• Image Updates: Replace existing images or add new ones to the images folder as
needed.
• Dependency Updates: Regularly check for updates to external dependencies such as
Remix Icon and ScrollReveal libraries.
• Testing: After making changes, thoroughly test the website across different devices
and browsers to ensure compatibility and functionality.


Challenges Faced and Solutions
During the redesign process, the main challenges encountered were:
• Responsive Design: Ensuring consistent display and functionality across various
devices posed a challenge. This was addressed by using responsive design principles
and testing the website extensively on different devices.
• Integration of Google Maps: Integrating Google Maps to display the location of the
guest house required careful implementation. This was achieved by embedding the
map iframe and adjusting its parameters to fit the layout seamlessly.
• Animation Implementation: Implementing animations for a dynamic user experience
required careful consideration of performance and compatibility. ScrollReveal library
was chosen for its ease of use and compatibility with modern web browsers.
